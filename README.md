(very much in the works)



### Development

`avmp` defines everything in code. No `.ui` or other design tools
are used. I wanted a codebase that was easy to get started with,
so there's no need to learn Qt Creator or others.



##### dependencies

- [doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/), for documentation



##### building and configuring

To generate documentation, use

`doxygen Doxyfile`
